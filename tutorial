### Step-by-Step Tutorial: Creating a Sequencing Project in SIMATIC Manager

#### Step 1: Open SIMATIC Manager
1. **Launch the Software**: Start by opening Siemens SIMATIC Manager on your computer. You can find it in your program list or use the desktop shortcut if available.

#### Step 2: Create a New Project
1. **Go to File Menu**: Click on `File` in the top menu bar.
2. **Select New**: Click on `New...` from the dropdown menu.
3. **Name the Project**: Enter a name for your project, such as "SequencingLogicProject".
4. **Choose the Location**: Select a folder where you want to save your project.
5. **Click OK**: Once you have entered the name and selected the location, click `OK` to create the project.

#### Step 3: Configure Hardware
1. **Open Project**: Your new project will appear in the SIMATIC Manager window. Double-click on the project name to open it.
2. **Insert a New Station**: Right-click on the project name, go to `Insert New Object` > `SIMATIC 300 Station` (or the type of PLC you are using).
3. **Open Hardware Configuration**: Double-click on `SIMATIC 300 Station` (or relevant station type), then double-click on `Hardware` to open the hardware configuration tool.
4. **Add PLC Rack and Modules**:
   - **Insert Rack**: In the hardware configuration window, drag a rail from the hardware catalog (usually found on the right pane) into the main configuration area.
   - **Add CPU**: Select the appropriate CPU from the hardware catalog and drag it into the first slot of the rack.
   - **Add Modules**: Drag and drop the required input/output modules, power supply modules, and any other necessary modules into the appropriate slots on the rack.

5. **Configure I/O Addresses**: Double-click on each module to configure its parameters, such as input/output addresses, and ensure that they match your hardware setup.

6. **Save and Compile**: After configuring the hardware, click on the `Save` icon, then click on the `Compile and Save` button to ensure there are no errors in your hardware configuration.

#### Step 4: Create a New Program Block
1. **Open Blocks Folder**: In the project tree, expand the `Blocks` folder.
2. **Insert New Block**: Right-click on the `Blocks` folder and select `Insert New Object` > `Organization Block`.
3. **Select OB Type**: Choose `OB1 (Main)` as this is the main program block that gets executed in a PLC cycle. Click `OK`.
4. **Name the Block**: You can keep the default name `OB1` or rename it as needed.

#### Step 5: Implement Sequencing Logic in Ladder Logic (LAD)
1. **Open OB1**: Double-click on `OB1` to open the program editor.
2. **Switch to LAD Editor**: Ensure you are in the Ladder Logic (LAD) editor. If not, select LAD from the editor options.
3. **Add Rungs for Sequencing Logic**:
   - **First Rung**: Implement the logic for turning on LED 1 on the first push button press. Use a set coil (`S`) for the output corresponding to LED 1.
   - **Second Rung**: Implement the logic for turning on LED 2 on the second press and turning off LED 1. Use a set coil (`S`) for LED 2 and a reset coil (`R`) for LED 1.
   - **Third Rung**: Implement the logic for turning on LED 3 on the third press and turning off LED 2. Use a set coil (`S`) for LED 3 and a reset coil (`R`) for LED 2.
   - **Fourth Rung**: Implement the logic for turning off all LEDs on the fourth press. Use reset coils (`R`) for LEDs 1, 2, and 3.

4. **Save and Compile the Program**: Click on the `Save` icon, then click `Compile` to check for errors in your program logic.

#### Step 6: Download the Program to the PLC
1. **Ensure PLC is Connected**: Make sure your PLC is properly connected to your computer via Ethernet or a serial connection.
2. **Go Online**: In SIMATIC Manager, click on the `PLC` menu and select `Download`.
3. **Select Download Options**: Choose the appropriate options (e.g., download all blocks or specific ones).
4. **Start Download**: Click `OK` to begin the download process to the PLC.
5. **Monitor Status**: Watch the status messages to ensure the program is downloaded successfully without any errors.

#### Step 7: Test the Sequencing Logic
1. **Switch to Online Mode**: In SIMATIC Manager, go to `PLC` > `Online` to switch to the online mode.
2. **Monitor and Force I/O**: Use the monitoring tools to check the status of the inputs and outputs. You can force the input (e.g., the push button) to simulate button presses.
3. **Observe LED Status**: Observe the outputs to ensure that the LEDs behave as expected with each press of the button, following the sequence you programmed.

#### Step 8: Save and Document Your Work
1. **Save Project**: Click `File` > `Save` to save your project with all the changes.
2. **Export Project**: If needed, you can export your project for backup or sharing purposes.

#### Step 9: Back Up Your Project
1. **Back Up Regularly**: Always back up your project files to avoid data loss.
